<p>In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, 
especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. 
We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.</p>
<p>Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax. 
Also make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.</p>
